	started with linked list.
	
    Q1.  Construct a LL from a vector 
    	
    	Node* constructLL(vector<int>& arr) {
    	    //declare a new node as head
	    Node* head = new Node(arr[0]);
	    
	    // temp initially pointing to head
	    Node* mover = head ;
	    
	    // iterate and add elements individually 
	    for(int i = 1; i< arr.size(); i++){
		Node* temp = new Node(arr[i]);
		mover->next = temp;
		mover = mover->next;
	    	}
	    //return the on pointing to head
	    return head; 
	   }

	Q2. Inserting a node in a linked list 
		
		//iterate till the positon create a new node 
		add the desired value make the prev node point to
		the newly created node ... and the new node will 
		point to the next node ..
		
	Q3. Delete a node in LL
		
		// les say the node to delete is node x..
		copy the data from x+1 node to x node and 
		make the x node point to x+2 node.
